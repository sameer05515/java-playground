Here’s an enhanced version with additional suggestions and details:

# Recommended Changes in TweetApp

## General Changes

- There must be a workflow for every node
  type ([Topics](#topics), [Tasks](#tasks), [Links](#links), [Tags](#tags), [Interview Questions and Answers](#interview-questions-and-answers)).
    - Every node should have a `publish` status if it is fully groomed.
    - Initially, every node should be in a `drafted` status.

### Suggested Node Workflow

1. **Drafted**: The default status for all newly created nodes.
2. **In Progress**: When a node is actively being edited or refined.
3. **Ready for Review**: Nodes awaiting approval or verification.
4. **Published**: Finalized and visible to the public or target users.
5. **Archived**: Outdated or no longer relevant nodes should be moved to an archive for reference.

## Node Type-Specific Changes

### Topics

- Add support for **sub-topics** to create hierarchical structures.
- Allow users to link related topics for cross-referencing.
- Provide a rich text editor for formatting content with headers, lists, and code blocks.

### Tasks

- Integrate **due dates** and **priority levels** (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
- Allow task assignment to specific users or teams.
- Include a progress tracking system with stages (e.g., To-Do, In Progress, Done).

### Links

- Add **categories** for organizing links (e.g., Tutorials, Documentation, Tools).
- Enable preview generation for links (e.g., thumbnails and meta descriptions).
- Provide a click tracker to monitor the usage of links.

### Tags

- Support **tag hierarchy** (e.g., Parent Tags → Sub Tags).
- Allow users to view all nodes associated with a specific tag.
- Enable merging duplicate tags and tracking tag usage trends.

### Interview Questions and Answers

- Add the ability to categorize Q&A (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard).
- Enable users to mark questions as solved or unsolved.
- Provide options for upvoting answers to promote the best responses.

## Non-Functional Recommendations

- **API Enhancements**: Introduce a consistent response structure for all node-related APIs.
- **User Roles**: Implement role-based access control to determine who can create, edit, or publish nodes.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize backend queries for faster retrieval of node data, especially for large
  datasets.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Create a dashboard showing node status statistics (e.g., Drafted, Published, In Progress).
- **Versioning**: Maintain version history for nodes, allowing users to revert to earlier versions.

These recommendations aim to improve functionality, usability, and performance while ensuring scalability for future
enhancements.
