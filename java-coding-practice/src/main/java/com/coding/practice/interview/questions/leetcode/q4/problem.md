# Add Two Numbers - Linked List

## Problem Statement

You are given two **non-empty linked lists** representing two **non-negative integers**.  
The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each node contains a single digit.  

Write a function to **add the two numbers** and return the sum as a linked list.

### Key Assumptions
- The two numbers do not contain any leading zeros, except for the number `0` itself.
- Each node's value is in the range `[0, 9]`.

---

## Examples

### Example 1
```plaintext
Input: 
l1 = [2, 4, 3]  (represents 342)
l2 = [5, 6, 4]  (represents 465)

Output:
[7, 0, 8]  (represents 807)

Explanation: 
342 + 465 = 807
```

### Example 2
```plaintext
Input:
l1 = [0]
l2 = [0]

Output:
[0]
```

### Example 3
```plaintext
Input:
l1 = [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]  (represents 9999999)
l2 = [9, 9, 9, 9]  (represents 9999)

Output:
[8, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 1]  (represents 10009998)

Explanation: 
9999999 + 9999 = 10009998
```

## Constraints

1. The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range **[1, 100]**.
2. Each node's value is a single digit between **0** and **9**.
3. It is guaranteed that the numbers represented by the linked lists do not have leading zeros.

---

## Interactive Input Section

To solve this problem interactively:
1. **Create two linked lists** by providing their digits in reverse order.
2. Call the `addTwoNumbers` function to compute the result.

### Example Interactive Code (JavaScript)
```javascript
class ListNode {
  constructor(val = 0, next = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.next = next;
  }
}

// Function to add two numbers
function addTwoNumbers(l1, l2) {
  let dummy = new ListNode();
  let current = dummy;
  let carry = 0;

  while (l1 || l2 || carry) {
    const sum = (l1?.val || 0) + (l2?.val || 0) + carry;
    carry = Math.floor(sum / 10);
    current.next = new ListNode(sum % 10);
    current = current.next;

    l1 = l1?.next || null;
    l2 = l2?.next || null;
  }

  return dummy.next;
}

// Example usage:
const l1 = new ListNode(2, new ListNode(4, new ListNode(3))); // [2, 4, 3]
const l2 = new ListNode(5, new ListNode(6, new ListNode(4))); // [5, 6, 4]

const result = addTwoNumbers(l1, l2);

function printList(node) {
  const result = [];
  while (node) {
    result.push(node.val);
    node = node.next;
  }
  console.log(result.join(' -> '));
}

// Output the result
printList(result); // Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
```

## Key Learning Points
1. Understand how linked lists work and how to traverse them.
2. Learn how to handle **carry** during addition.
3. Practice creating and manipulating nodes in a linked list.

## Try It Yourself

### Steps:
1. Define your linked lists based on the input examples.
2. Implement the function in your preferred language.
3. Verify your results against the provided examples.

### Example Inputs for Practice
- `l1 = [2, 4, 3]`, `l2 = [5, 6, 4]`
- `l1 = [0]`, `l2 = [0]`
- `l1 = [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]`, `l2 = [9, 9, 9, 9]`
